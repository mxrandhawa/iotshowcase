i. Abstract
WaterML 2.0 is a standard information model for the representation of water
observations data, with the intent of allowing the exchange of such data sets across
information systems. Through the use of existing OGC standards, it aims at being an
interoperable exchange format that may be re-used to address a range of exchange
requirements, some of which are described later in this document.
ii. Preface
The primary goal of this profile is to capture the semantics of hydrological observational
data for data exchange. This will allow hydrological information systems to communicate
data between systems and to end users.
NOTE!! - Please note that 2.0.1 is a Corrigendum in which a number of errors have been
corrected in the WaterML 2.0 schema. As such, please make sure that your application
re-loads the schema from the OGC schema repository and that local copies are not being
used.

Foreword
This work has, for the most part, been funded through a water information research and
development alliance between CSIRO‘s Water for a Healthy Country Flagship and the
Australian Bureau of Meteorology. The work has also been supported by The Consortium
for the Advancement of Hydrological Sciences Inc. (CUAHSI). The work is operating
under the joint World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and Open Geospatial
Consortium (OGC) Hydrology Domain Working Group [1].
Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be
the subject of patent rights. Open Geospatial Consortium shall not be held responsible
for identifying any or all such patent rights. However, to date, no such rights have been
claimed or identified.
Recipients of this document are requested to submit, with their comments, notification of
any relevant patent claims or other intellectual property rights of which they may be
aware that might be infringed by any implementation of the specification set forth in this
document, and to provide supporting documentation.
This document formalises work discussed in the existing discussion documents OGC 09-
124r1 – Harmonising Standards for Water Observations Data and 07-041- WaterML.

4 Terms and Definitions
For the purpose of this document, the following terms and definitions apply:
Coverage
Feature that acts as a function to return values from its range for any direct position within its
spatial, temporal or spatiotemporal domain.
[ISO 19123:2005, definition 4.17]
Discharge
In its simplest concept discharge means outflow; therefore, the use of this term is not restricted as
to course or location, and it can be applied to describe the flow of water from a pipe or from a
drainage basin. If the discharge occurs in some course or channel, it is correct to speak of the
discharge of a canal or of a river. It is also correct to speak of the discharge of a canal or stream
into a lake, a stream, or an ocean.
[USGS, http://water.usgs.gov/wsc/glossary.html#Discharge]
Domain feature
Feature of a type defined within a particular application domain
NOTE: This may be contrasted with observations and sampling features, which are features of
types defined for cross-domain purposes.
[ISO 19156, definition 4.4]
Feature
Abstraction of real-world phenomena
[ISO 19101:2002, definition 4.11]
Observation
Act of observing a property
[ISO19156, definition 4.10]
Observation procedure
Method, algorithm or instrument, or system of these which may be used in making an observation
[ISO19156, definition 4.11]
Property <General Feature Model>
Facet or attribute of an object referenced by a name
EXAMPLE: Abby's car has the colour red, where "colour red" is a property of the car instance
Sampling feature
