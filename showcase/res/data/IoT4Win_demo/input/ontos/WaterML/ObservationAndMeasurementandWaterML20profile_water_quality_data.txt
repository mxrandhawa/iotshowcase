In addition to stating the rules for using the O&M and WML 2 standards, along with the appropriate content ontologies, this Best Practice provides guidance through examples. This document is intended to complement WaterML 2.0 as part of a suite of standards for water observation data.

ii. Keywords

The following are keywords to be used by search engines and document catalogues.

Scope

The purpose of this Best Practice is to describe how the Observations & Measurements and WaterML 2 standards are to be used to deliver Water Quality data.

The following items are considered out of scope for this report:

    Key existing water-related domain information models, such as GroundWaterML and HY_Feature, are identified in this report and suggestions made on how to use these existing models, but no attempt is made to harmonise or replace them.
    Modelling the water quality semantic content, or vocabularies, required for the information model.

OMXML provides an O&M XML implementations of sampling feature types, such as SF_SamplingPoint (‘station’), SF_SamplingCurve (observation boreholes, trajectories, traverses), and SF_Specimen (physical samples), that are used frequently in water quality observations, and thus are likely to be useful when transferring datasets. However, at this time we do not consider it necessary to introduce specific requirements concerning the use of these types for water quality data.

Similarly, WML2 does not restrict the feature of interest to be only point-based sampling features. It does, however, identify that this is a common pattern for in-situ monitoring and captures this in the “monitoring point feature of interest” requirements class (Taylor, 2012).
Conformance

This Standard defines an XML implementation of models for describing water quality observations and time series. The implementation is described using the XML Schema language and Schematron.

Requirements for one standardization target type are considered:

    data instances

i.e. XML documents that encode observation data for exchange. Since data producing applications should generate conformant data instances, the requirements and tests described in this standard effectively also apply to that standardization target.

Conformance with this standard shall be checked using all the relevant tests specified in Annex A (normative) of this document.

 

All requirements-classes and conformance-classes described in this document are owned by the standard(s) identified.

Conventions
Requirements class

Each normative statement (requirement or recommendation) in this standard is a member of a requirements class. Each requirements class is described in a discrete clause or sub-clause, and summarized using the following template:

Requirements class 	/req/{classM}

Target type
	

[artefact or technology type]

Dependency
	

[identifier for another requirements class]

Requirement
	

/req/{classM}/{reqN}

Recommendation
	

/req/{classM}/{recO}

Requirement
	

/req/{classM}/{reqP}

Requirement /Recommendation
	

[repeat as necessary]

 

All requirements in a class must be satisfied. Hence, the requirements class is the unit of re-use and dependency, and the value of a Dependency requirement is another requirements class. All requirements in a dependency must also be satisfied by a conforming implementation. A requirements class may consist only of dependencies and introduce no new requirements.
Requirement

All requirements are normative, and each requirement is presented using the following template:

/req/[classM]/[reqN]
	

[Normative statement]

 

where /req/[classM]/[reqN] identifies the requirement or recommendation. The use of this layout convention allows the normative provisions of this Standard to be easily located by implementers.
Conformance class

Conformance to this Standard is possible at a number of levels, specified by conformance classes (Annex A). Each conformance class is summarized using the following template:

Conformance class 	/conf/{classM}

Dependency
	

[identifier for another conformance class]

Requirements
	

/req/{classA}

Tests
	

[reference to clause(s) containing tests]

 

All tests in a class must be passed, so dependencies are on other conformance classes. Each conformance class tests conformance to a set of requirements packaged in a requirements class.
Identifiers

Each requirements class, requirement and recommendation is identified by a URI. The identifier supports cross-referencing of class membership, dependencies, and links from each conformance test to requirements tested. In this standard identifiers are expressed as partial URIs or paths, which can be appended to a base URI that identifies the standard as a whole in order to construct a complete URI for identification in an external context

The URI for each requirements class has the form

http://www.opengis.net/spec/watermlwq/1.0/req/[classM]

The URI for each requirement or recommendation has the form

http://www.opengis.net/spec/watermlwq/1.0/req/[classM]/[reqN]

The URI for each conformance class has the form

http://www.opengis.net/spec/watermlwq/1.0/conf/[classM]

The URI for each conformance test has the form

http://www.opengis.net/spec/watermlwq/1.0/conf/[classM]/[testN]
Conceptual schemas

Conceptual schemas in the normative part of this Standard are presented in the Unified Modeling Language (UML). UML diagrams are presented in compliance with ISO/IEC 19505-2. No conceptual schemas have been created as part of this standard, with the UML diagrams being for informative purposes only (Chapter 4).

Background
Technical Basis

This OGC Best Practice builds on the OMXML standard for encoding observations.

OMXML provides a single XML element for generic observations (i.e. <om:OM_Observation>). The standard observation result has an unspecified type (implemented as the XML Schema wildcard type=’xs:anyType’). The types of other observation properties observed-property, feature-of-interest, and observation procedure are also generic. Observations can be specialized for particular applications by restricting the type or source of these properties. For the XML encoding this may be achieved either using a specialized XML Schema, or by supplementing the XML Schema for the generic case with Schematron rules to test the type or value of the properties.

OMXML itself provides a standard set of observation types specialized by result type. In this standard we use the OMXML encoding for Measurement (i.e. observations whose result is a scaled number) for the case of single observations of water quality, and add constraints on the observed property, units of measure, and feature of interest.

WaterML 2.0 (part 1) is an existing specialization of OMXML, in which (i) the result is a time-series; and (ii) the sampling feature-of-interest is a monitoring station. In this standard we use the WaterML 2.0 encoding for water quality time-series, and add constraints on the observed property, units of measure, and ultimate (sampled) feature of interest.

It is also notable that OMXML provides XML implementations of the sampling feature types defined in O&M 2.0. Several of these concepts, such as SF_SamplingPoint (‘station’), SF_SamplingCurve (observation boreholes, trajectories, traverses), and SF_Specimen (i.e. physical samples) are used frequently in water quality observations, and thus the XML implementation are likely to be useful when transferring datasets. However, at this time we do not consider it necessary to introduce specific requirements concerning the use of these types for water quality data.

The core of WaterML2.0 also does not restrict the feature of interest to be only point-based sampling features. It does, however, identify that this is a common pattern for in-situ monitoring and captures this in the “monitoring point feature of interest” requirements class. It is thus possible to use different sampling features as the target feature. For example, the time series observation may describe the average value of a polygon through time (Taylor, 2012).
Classification of water quality observations

We distinguish between two forms of water quality observations:

      single measurements of a single water quality parameter, where the result is a scalar value
      multiple measurements of a single water quality parameter related to a single location, where the result is organized into a time-series, as time-value pairs (TVP).

These are represented in separate requirements classes and corresponding conformance classes. By structuring the standard in this way, a conformant implementation need only implement those classes that are necessary. Components that connect to the implementation have a precise specification of the implementation and can develop their application to match.

Within a dataset, each observation relates to a single water quality parameter. This follows the precedent set by WML 2.0. If multiple water quality parameters are measured, then data for each parameter is encoded as a separate observation (though potentially packaged in a single dataset or file). While various methods have been used previously to combine multi-parameter data into a single object, this results in multiple alternative ways of representing the same data. In the interests of minimising variability, and thus simplifying the design of client applications, multi-parameter data is not interleaved. The client is responsible for combining data if required.


Information Model
Water Quality package dependencies

Figure 1 provides a view of the primary requirements classes in this standard, modeled as UML packages, and their dependencies.

Water Quality package dependencies on O&M and WaterML 2
Figure 1: Water Quality package dependencies on O&M and WaterML 2

WML2 specifies time series as either time-value pairs or domain ranges (Taylor, 2012). Although the normative UML requirements for both have been specified, the specification for a GML XML Schema implementation that is compliant with the UML model has only been provided for time-value pair time series. No attempt has been made here to provide water quality requirements for domain range time series.
Water Quality informative classes

Figure 2 shows the types and elements defined in this standard, modeled as UML classes, focusing on the Water Quality-specific constraints. The Water Quality classes are shown as subtypes of O&M and WML2 classes. Because of the encoding rule used, these classes do not appear explicitly in XML representation of Water Quality data instances; rather, the general O&M and WaterML 2 classes appear, with appropriate constraints on aspects of their content-models.

Water Quality classes as sub-types of O&M and WaterML 2 classes
Figure 2: Water Quality classes as sub-types of O&M and WaterML 2 classes

The notes in Figure 2 specify the restrictions on the general O&M and WML2 models required for water quality data. It is intended that these constraints would be validated using Schematron for the XML representation.


Requirements Class: Time series XML rules

Observations of water quality use either the OMXML element OM_Measurement or the WML2 element MeasurementTimeseries. The units of measure used in the result are taken from a water quality vocabulary. This requirement is a modification of the units of measure requirement in the WML2 requirements classhttp://www.opengis.net/spec/waterml/2.0/req/xsd-xml-rules.  In addition, the WML2 requirements class http://www.opengis.net/spec/waterml/2.0/req/xsd-xml-rules/time-zone has been modified to include all time elements, not just those associated with time series. Otherwise, this requirements class is the same as that class. The requirements reused from WML2 are repeated here for convenience.

Recommendation
	

http://www.opengis.net/spec/waterml/2.0/req/xsd-xml-rules/vocabulary-references

 

The date-time formats will conform to ISO standards.

http://www.opengis.net/spec/waterml/2.0
/req/xsd-xml-rules/iso8601-time
	

All date-time elements shall be encoded using ISO8601 extended time format

 

Note that this precludes the use of time-coordinate systems such as UNIX time. This is specified in order to be maximally consistent with WML2 requirements. The time zone will be included in the time element.

/req/xsd-xml-rules/time-zone
	

The value of each time element shall include a time zone definition using a signed 4 digit character or a ‘Z’ to represent Zulu or Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This is defined by the following regular expression:

(Z|[+-]HH:MM)

 

The units of measure shall be taken from a standard water quality vocabulary governed by the water community.

/req/xsd-xml-rules/unit-of-measure
	

All units of measure shall be specified using  the URI for an individual from the class http://qudt.org/schema/qudt#Unit defined in http://environment.data.gov.au/def/unit

 

The unit of measure must be suitable for the observed property (constraint inherited from OM_Observation).

Some SWE Common types are restricted to avoid ambiguity.

http://www.opengis.net/spec/waterml/2.0/req/xsd-xml-rules/swe-types 	

When using the SWE Common types, the following elements shall not be used: swe:quality (AbstractSimpleComponentType), swe:nilValues (AbstractSimpleComponentType), swe:constraint (QuantityType, QuantityRangeType, CategoryType). The attributes ‘optional’ and ‘updatable’ from the base type ‘AbstractDataComponent’ shall not be used.

 

The xlink:title attribute ought contain a text label when an xlink:href refers to a controlled vocabulary or ontology.

http://www.opengis.net/spec/waterml/2.0/req/xsd-xml-rules/xlink-title 	

If an xlink:href is used to reference a controlled vocabulary item, the element should encode the xlink:title attribute with a text label of the referenced item.

 

Vocabulary references made via xlink:href ought to be a resolvable URI in the form of an HTTP URL.

http://www.opengis.net/spec/waterml/2.0/rec/xsd-xml-rules/vocabulary-references
	

When specifying references to vocabulary (code) items using an xlink:href, a resolvable HTTP URL should be used which, when resolved, should provide suitable description of the concept being referenced. 

 

This requirements class defines common rules and recommendations for all XML instances.


 
Requirements class: observations (WQ_Observation)

Concrete observations of water quality use the O&M element OM_Measurement or the WML2 element MeasurementTimeseriesTVPObservation. The observed property common to these elements inherited from OM_Observation is taken from a standard vocabulary. The feature of interest property common to these elements comes from a water domain specific feature catalogue.

The observed property of the observation is to be taken from a standard water quality vocabulary governed by the water community.

/req/observation/observed-property
	

The XML element om:observedProperty SHALL have an xlink:href property whose value is the URI for an individual from the class http://environment.data.gov.au/def/op#PropertyKind defined in http://environment.data.gov.au/def/property

 

The ultimate feature of interest (domain sampled feature) is a water specific domain feature.

/req/observation/feature-of-interest
	

The value of the href:xlink property is a URI that SHOULD denote a feature of a suitable type[1].

 

This is the core requirements class for all XML instances of water quality observations.


 
Requirements class: single measurements (WQ_Measurement)

Single observations of water quality use the O&M element OM_Measurement, and require that the units of measure used in the result are taken from a standard vocabulary.

The value of the om:result/@uom SHALL be the URI for an individual from the class http://qudt.org/schema/qudt#Unit defined in http://environment.data.gov.au/def/unit

 

The unit of measure must be suitable for the observed property (constraint inherited from OM_Observation).

This is the requirements class for all XML instances of single water quality measurements.

/req/tvp-measurement/result-units

 

The units of measure used in the time value pair measurement result are required to be taken from a standard water quality vocabulary governed by the water community.

/req/tvp-measurement/result-units
	

The value of the wml2:defaultPointMetadata wml2:uom xlink:href SHALL be the URI for an individual from the class http://qudt.org/schema/qudt#Unit defined in http://environment.data.gov.au/def/unit

 

This is the requirements class for all XML instances of time series water quality measurements.


Requirements class: time series time-value pair observations (WQ_MeasurementTimeSeriesTVPObservations)

Time-value pair (tvp) time series observations of water quality use the WML2 element MeasurementTimeseriesTVPObservation with observed property and feauture of interest content constrained by WQ_Observation and units of measure constrained by WQ_MeasurementTimeSeriesTVP.

Media Types for water quality data

Water quality data conforming to this specification is encoded in GML-conformant XML documents. The standard MIME-type and sub-type for GML data should be used to indicate the encoding in internet exchange, as specified in MIME Media Types for GML, namely

application/gml+xml


Annex A: Abstract Test Suite (Normative)
A.1 Introduction

The test suite is structured into 5 conformance classes. Each conformance class is related to one requirements class from clause 5. Each conformance class contains a number of abstract tests[2]. Each test relates to one or more specific requirements, which are explicitly indicated in the description of the test.

There is a dependency on the conformance class for GML documents, defined in clause 2.4 (with the test suite in A.3) of OGC Geography Markup Language v3.2.

There is a dependency on the conformance class for Geographic Metadata XML encoding, described in Clause 2 and Annex A of Geographic information – metadata – XML implementation.

There are dependencies on the following conformance classes for Observations and Measurements XML encoding, described in Annex A of Observations and Measurements – XML implementation:

http://www.opengis.net/spec/OMXML/2.0/conf/observation
http://www.opengis.net/spec/OMXML/2.0/conf/measurement

There are dependencies on the following conformance classes for WaterML 2 XML encoding described in Annex 2 WaterML 2.0: Part 1- Timeseries:

http://www.opengis.net/spec/waterml/2.0/conf/xsd-measurement-timeseries-tvp
http://www.opengis.net/spec/waterml/2.0/req/xsd-measurement-timeseries-tvp-observation

 
A.2 Conformance class: XSD-XML rules

This is the core conformance class for XML implementation of Water Quality.

This conformance class is based on the WML2 http://www.opengis.net/spec/waterml/2.0/conf/xsd-xml-rules conformance class, but changes the units of measure from UCUM to those appropriate for Water Quality.

There is a dependency on the conformance class for GML documents, defined in clause 2.4 (with the test suite in A.3) of OGC Geography Markup Language v3.2.

There is a dependency on the conformance class for Geographic Metadata XML encoding, described in Clause 2 and Annex A of Geographic information – metadata – XML implementation.
