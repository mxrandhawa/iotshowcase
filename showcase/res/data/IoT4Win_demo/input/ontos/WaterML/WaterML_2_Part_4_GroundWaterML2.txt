Motivation

A significant portion of the global water supply can be attributed to groundwater resources. Effective management of such resources requires the collection, management and delivery of related data, but these are impeded by issues related to data availability, distribution, fragmentation, and heterogeneity: collected data are not all readily available and accessible, available data is distributed across many agencies in different sectors, often thematically fragmented, and similar types of data are diversely structured by the various data providers. This situation holds both within and between political entities, such as countries or states, impairing groundwater management across all jurisdictions. Groundwater data networks are an emerging solution to this problem as they couple data providers through a unified data delivery vehicle, thus reducing or eliminating distribution, fragmentation, and heterogeneity through the incorporation of standards for data access and data content. The relative maturity of OGC data access standards, such as the Web Feature Service (WFS) and Sensor Observation Service (SOS), combined with the rise of water data networks, have created a need for GroundWaterML2 (GWML2), a common groundwater data standard.

Historical background

Several activities have influenced the development of GWML2.

    GWML1: a GML application schema for groundwater data developed at Natural Resources Canada and used to exchange groundwater data within Canada, between Canada and the USA, and in some other international efforts (Boisvert & Brodaric, 2012).
    GWIE1: an interoperability experiment within the OGC HDWG, in which groundwater data was shared across the USA-Canada border (Brodaric & Booth, 2011).
    GW2IE: a second interoperability experiment within the OGC HDWG, that designed and tested a precursor of GroundWaterML2 (GWML2, version 2.1): a conceptual, logical, and encoding specification for the representation of core groundwater data (OGC, 2016).
    INSPIRE Data Specification on Geology – hydrogeology package : a conceptual model and GML application schema for hydrogeology (INSPIRE, 2013), with regulatory force in the European Union and for which GWML2 is expected to be an encoding candidate.

BDLISA: the French Water Information System information models for water wells and hydrogeological features (BDLISA, 2013).

The primary goal of this standard is to capture the semantics, schema, and encoding syntax of key groundwater data, to enable information systems to interoperate with such data.

1.    Scope

This document is an OGC® conceptual, logical and encoding standard for GWML2, which represents key groundwater data. GWML2 is implemented as an application schema of the Geography Markup Language (GML) version 3.2.1, and re-uses entities from other GML application schema, most notably the OGC Observations & Measurements standard and the OGC/IUGS GeoSciML 4.0  (OGC 16-008) standard. GWML2 version 2.2 (this document) updates version 2.1, which was developed by the GW2IE (OGC, 2016), by importing GeoSciML 4.0 instead of GeoSciML 3.2.0, and by using TimeseriesML (OGC 15-042r2) instead of OGC WaterML2.0 part 1 – Timeseries.

GWML2 is designed to enable a variety of data exchange scenarios. These scenarios are captured by its five motivating use cases, including:

    a commercial use-case focused on drilling water wells with knowledge of aquifers,
    a policy use case concerned with the management of groundwater resources,
    an environmental use-case that considers the role of groundwater in natural eco-systems,
    a scientific use-case concerned with modeling groundwater systems, and
    a technologic use-case concerned with interoperability between diverse information systems and associated data formats.

GWML2 is designed in three stages, each consisting of a schema that builds on the previous stages. The three schemas include:

    Conceptual (UML): a technology-neutral schema denoting the semantics of the domain,
    Logical (UML): a GML-specific schema that incorporates the OGC suite of standards,
    XML schema (XSD): a GML syntactical encoding of the logical schema.

In addition, this standard describes general and XML-specific encoding requirements, general and XML-specific conformance tests, and XML encoding examples. The standard is designed for future extension into other non-XML encoding syntaxes, which would require each such encoding to describe the related schema, requirements and conformance classes, as well as provide examples.

The GWML2 Logical and XML schemas are organized into 6 modular packages:

    GWML2-Main: core elements such as aquifers, their pores, and fluid bodies,
    GWML2-Constituent: the biologic, chemical, and material constituents of a fluid body,
    GWML2-Flow: groundwater flow within and between containers,
    GWML2-Well: water wells, springs, and monitoring sites,
    GWML2-WellConstruction: the components used to construct a well,
    GWML2-AquiferTest: the elements comprising an aquifer test (e.g. a pumping test).

Altogether, the schemas and packages represent a machine-readable description of the key features associated with the groundwater domain, as well as their properties and relationships. This provides a semantics and syntax for the correct machine interpretation of the data, which promotes proper use of the data in further analysis. Existing systems can use GWML2 to ‘bridge’ between existing schema or systems, allowing consistency of the data to be maintained and enabling interoperability.
2.    Conformance

This standard has been written to be compliant with the OGC Specification Model – A Standard for Modular Specification (OGC 08-131r3). Extensions of this standard shall themselves be conformant to the OGC Specification Model.

The XML implementation (encoding) of the conceptual and logical groundwater schemas is described using the XML Schema language and Schematron.

Requirements for one standardization target type are considered:

    data instances.

i.e. XML documents that encode groundwater data. As data producing applications should generate conformant data instances, the requirements and tests described in this standard effectively also apply to that target.

Conformance with this standard shall be checked using all the relevant tests specified in Annex A (normative) of this document. The framework, concepts, and methodology for testing, and the criteria to be achieved to claim conformance are specified in ISO 19105: Geographic information — Conformance and Testing. In order to conform to this OGCencoding standard, a standardization target shall implement the core conformance class, and choose to implement any one of the other conformance classes (i.e. extensions).

All requirements-classes and conformance-classes described in this document are owned by the standard(s) identified.
2.2    Use of vocabularies

Controlled vocabularies, also known as code-lists, are used in data exchange to identify particular concepts or terms, and sometimes relationships between them. For example, an organization may define a controlled vocabulary for all observed phenomena, such as water quality parameters, that are to be exchanged between parties. Some of these definitions may be related by hierarchical relationships, such as specialization, or through other relationships such as equivalence.

GroundWaterML2.0 does not define a set of vocabularies for groundwater data exchange in this version. It is envisaged that specific communities will develop local vocabularies for data exchange within the community. Future work within the Hydrology Domain Working Group could address standardized controlled vocabularies for the groundwater domain. Such vocabularies require a governance structure that allows changes to be made as definitions evolve, possibly using the OGC definition namespace (http://www.opengis.net/def/gwml/2.2), which is governed by the OGC Naming Authority (OGC-NA). The OGC-NA is responsible for processing requests to change or add new definitions to this namespace. The procedures for the OGC-NA are outlined in OGC document 09-046 (OGC-NA – Procedures) and the structure of URIs is outlined in OGC 09-048 (OGC-NA – Name type specification – definitions).

The following convention has been used throughout the document to identify attributes requiring controlled vocabularies:

    In the conceptual model, such attributes are typed with a name ending by “Type” (ex : PorosityType); and
    In the logical model this suffix becomes ‘TypeTerm’ (ex : PorosityTypeTerm).

2.3    Groundwater data

Groundwater data conforming to this standard are encoded in GML-conformant XML documents, for this version of GWML2. It is anticipated that future versions or extensions will develop additional encodings such as JSON or RDF.  The standard MIME-type and sub-type for GML data should be used to indicate the encoding choice as specified in MIME Media Types for GML, namely: application/gml+xml.

Conformance with this standard shall be checked using all the relevant tests specified in Annex A (normative) of this document. The framework, concepts, and methodology for testing, and the criteria to be achieved to claim conformance are specified in the OGC Compliance Testing Policies and Procedures and the OGC Compliance Testing web site[1].

In order to conform to this OGC™interface standard, a software implementation shall choose to implement:

a)     Any one of the conformance levels specified in Annex A (normative).

All requirements-classes and conformance-classes described in this document are owned by the standard(s) identified.

5.    Conventions
5.1    Requirements class

Each normative statement (requirement or recommendation) in this standard is a member of a requirements class. Each requirements class is described in a discrete clause or sub-clause, and summarized using the following template:

Requirements class
	

/req/{classM}

Target type
	

[artefact or technology type]

Dependency
	

[identifier for another requirements class]

Requirement
	

/req/{classM}/{reqN}

Recommendation
	

/req/{classM}/{recO}

Requirement
	

/req/{classM}/{reqP}

Requirement /Recommendation
	

[repeat as necessary]

 

All requirements in a class must be satisfied. Hence, the requirements class is the unit of re-use and dependency, and the value of a dependency requirement is another requirements class. All requirements in a dependency must also be satisfied by a conforming implementation. A requirements class may consist only of dependencies and introduce no new requirements.
5.2    Requirement

All requirements are normative, and each is presented with the following template:

Requirement /req/[classM]/[reqN]

[Normative statement]

 

where /req/[classM]/[reqN] identifies the requirement or recommendation. The use of this layout convention allows the normative provisions of this standard to be easily located by implementers.
5.3    Conformance class

Conformance to this standard is possible at a number of levels, specified by conformance classes (Annex A). Each conformance class is summarized using the following template:

Conformance class 	/conf/{classM}

Dependency
	

[identifier for another conformance class]

Requirements
	

/req/{classA}

Tests
	

[reference to clause(s) containing tests]

 

All tests in a class must be passed. Each conformance class tests conformance to a set of requirements packaged in a requirements class.

W3C Schema (XSD) and ISO Schematron (SCH) files are considered as part of this standard, although available online only, due to concerns about document size. Many requirements are expressed in a single XSD or SCH file although tests are listed individually in the conformance annex (one test for XSD and one test for SCH). 

Schematron files explicitly specify which requirements are being tested in the title of the schematron pattern.


<pattern id="origin_elevation">
    <title>Test requirement: 
        /req/well-xsd/origin-elevation</title>
    <rule context="gwml2w:GW_Well">
        <assert
            test="count(gwml2w:gwWellReferenceElevation
            /gwml2w:Elevation[gwml2w:elevationType/
            @xlink:href=’http://www.opengis.net/
            req/well/origin_elevation’]) 
            = 1">A GW_Well needs at least one 
            origin Elevation</assert>
    </rule>
</pattern>

5.4    Identifiers

Each requirements class, requirement and recommendation is identified by a URI. The identifier supports cross-referencing of class membership, dependencies, and links from each conformance test to the requirements tested. In this standard, identifiers are expressed as partial URIs or paths, which can be appended to a base URI that identifies the specification as a whole in order to construct a complete URI for identification in an external context.

The URI for each requirements class has the form:

http://www.opengis.net/spec/groundwaterml/2.2/req/[classM].

The URI for each requirement or recommendation has the form:

http://www.opengis.net/spec/groundwaterml/2.2/req/[classM]/[reqN].

The URI for each conformance class has the form:

http://www.opengis.net/spec/groundwaterml/2.2/conf/[classM].

The URI for each conformance test has the form:

http://www.opengis.net/spec/groundwaterml/2.2/conf/[classM]/[testN].

5.8    Finding requirements and recommendations

This standard is identified as http://www.opengis.net/spec/groundwaterml/2.2. For clarity, each normative statement in this standard is in one and only one place, and defined within a requirements class table and identified with a URI, whose root is the standard URI. In this standard, all requirements are associated to tests in the abstract test suite in Annex A. using the URL of the requirement as the reference identifier. Recommendations are not tested but are assigned URLs and are identified using the ‘Recommendation’ label in the associated requirements table.

Requirements classes are separated into their own clauses, named, and specified according to inheritance (direct dependencies). The Conformance test classes in the test suite are similarly named to establish an explicit and mnemonic link between requirements classes and conformance test classes.
6.    Background
6.1    Technical Basis

This standard builds on a number of standards for encoding XML data, including:

    OMXML (OGC 10-025r1)
    sweCommon (OGC 08-094r1)
    GML  ISO 19136:2007 (OGC 07-036)
    ISO 19139 (Metadata)
    W3C XSD

This standard also builds on existing schema, primarily Observations & Measurements (OMXML) and GeoSciML 4.0 (OGC 16-008). It accomplishes this by (a) extending these schemas with groundwater specializations, (b) referring to a class in these schema in order to type a named property, or (c) using a class from the schemas as one of the two participants in a binary relationship.
6.2    Overview of Observations & Measurements

ISO19156 – Observations and Measurements is a generic GML schema for observations. As shown in Figure 1, it defines an observation as “…an act associated with a discrete time instant or period through which a number, term or other symbol is assigned to a phenomenon. It involves application of a specified procedure, such as a sensor, instrument, algorithm or process chain. The procedure may be applied in-situ, remotely, or ex-situ with respect to the sampling location. The result of an observation is an estimate of the value of a property of some feature.”
6.2.1    Sampling features

Sampling features in O&M are defined as a “feature, such as a station, transect, section or specimen, which is involved in making observations concerning a domain feature.” Sampling features in the groundwater domain are features along which, or upon, observations are made. The most relevant are water wells and boreholes, which effectively host observations along staged intervals; a collection of these intervals and their observations constitutes a log.

6.3    Overview of GeoSciML 4.0

GeoSciML 4.0 is a GML schema for core geological entities including geological units, structures, and earth materials. It is particularly relevant to GWML2 because bodies of rock serve as containers for subsurface water bodies. Such rock bodies possess variable hydrogeologic properties according to their material composition and topological organization. Thus, geological units and earth materials are the key GeoSciML 4.0 entities required by GWML2.

GeoSciML 4.0 defines a geological unit as “a body of material in the Earth whose complete and precise extent is inferred to exist (NADM GeologicUnit, Stratigraphic unit in sense of NACSN or International Stratigraphic Code), or a classifier used to characterize parts of the Earth (e.g. lithologic map unit like ‘granitic rock’ or ‘alluvial deposit’, surficial units like ‘till’ or ‘old alluvium’).”

GeoSciML 4.0 defines an earth material as “naturally occurring substance in the Earth” and intuitively refers to various types of rocks such as sandstone, granite, and gneiss.
7.    Conceptual Model

The GWML2 conceptual model is designed to be technology-neutral, and focused on the semantics of the groundwater domain. It consists of five components, as well as related properties and other entities: hydrogeological units, fluid bodies, voids, fluid flow, and wells. Conceptually, these entities form a simple template for a subsurface water container: the fluid container (a unit or its materials), the fluid itself (fluid body), the spaces in the container occupied by the fluid (void), the flow of fluid within and between containers and their spaces (flow), and the natural and artificial artifacts used to withdraw, inject, or monitor fluid with respect to a container (wells, springs, monitoring sites).

Well construction details are excluded from the conceptual model, but are included in the logical model for two reasons: (1) thematic, inasmuch as well construction was considered on the periphery of groundwater science, but important to resource management as well as important to significant data exchange scenarios, and (2) practical, as it is sufficiently modeled in GWML1 and could thus be directly imported with few changes. This eliminates the need for its re-conceptualization in the GWML2 conceptual model, keeping it tightly focused.
7.1    Hydrogeological Units

These are distinct volumes of earth material that serve as containers for subsurface fluids. The boundaries of a unit are typically discriminated from those of another unit using properties related to the potential or actual ability to contain or move water. The properties can be geological or hydraulic, and typically include influences from the surrounding hydrological environment. More specifically, the conceptual model delineates two types of hydrogeological units, with slightly different orientations: aquifer-related units have boundaries delimited by the hydrogeological properties of the rock body, while groundwater basins have boundaries delimited by distinct flow regimes. Aquifer-related units are subdivided into aquifer systems, which are collections of aquifers, confining beds, and other aquifer systems. Confining beds are units that impede water flow to surrounding units, and supersede notions such as aquitards, aquicludes, and aquifuges, which are not included herein, as it is difficult to differentiate these in practice.

Several significant properties are typically attributed to hydrogeological units, such as porosity, permeability, and conductivity, but these and others are modeled more accurately here as occurring necessarily concurrent with (dependent on) voids or fluid bodies. For example, porosity, in its various forms, requires both the presence of a unit (container) and its voids, as it is typically defined as the proportion of void volume to total unit volume (i.e. volume of solid material plus voids). Likewise, properties such as hydraulic conductivity and yield require the presence of units and fluid bodies, as they are concerned with the rate of movement of a fluid through a unit. Note that permeability and hydraulic conductivity are differentiated here: permeability refers to intrinsic permeability, which measures the ability of a unit to host fluid flow, independent of fluid properties and based solely on the connectivity and size of voids, whereas hydraulic conductivity additionally considers fluid properties.

Likewise, management areas are also relational entities in the sense that they are typically necessarily linked with a unit (or system) and possibly a fluid body. Management areas are earth bodies identified for groundwater management purposes and their boundaries can be delineated by social factors, such as policy or regulation, in addition to physical factors related to hydrogeology or hydrology.  
7.2    Fluid Bodies

These are distinct bodies of fluid (liquid or gas) that fill the voids in hydrogeological units. Fluid bodies are made of biologic (e.g. organisms), chemical (e.g. solutes), or material constituents (e.g. sediment). While it is expected that the major constituent of a fluid body will be water, the conceptual model allows for other types of major constituents such as petroleum. Minor constituents are not necessarily fluids, but can be gases, liquids, or solids (including organisms), and are included in the fluid body in various forms of mixture, such as solution, suspension, emulsion, and precipitates. Fluid bodies can also have other fluid bodies as parts, such as plumes or gas bubbles. Surfaces can be identified on a fluid body, such as a water table, piezometric or potentiometric surface, and some such surfaces can contain divides, which are lines projected to the fluid surface denoting divergence in the direction of flow systems within the fluid.
7.3    Voids

Voids are the spaces inside a unit (e.g. aquifer) or its material (e.g. the sandstone material of an aquifer), and might contain fluid bodies. Voids are differentiated from porosity, in that porosity is a ratio of void volume to total volume of unit plus voids, while voids are the spaces themselves. It is important to conceptually differentiate voids from units and their containers, in order to represent, for example, the volume of fractures, caves, or pores in a particular unit or its portion.
7.4    Flow

Groundwater flow denotes the process by which a fluid enters or exits a container (unit) or its voids, or flows within them. Flow between one container or void and another is named InterFlow, and flow within a container or void is named IntraFlow. Recharge is the flow into a groundwater container or void, and discharge is flow out of a groundwater container or void. The reciprocal source or destination entity can be any appropriate container or void such as a river, lake, pipe, reservoir, canyon, flood plain, ground surface, etc. A flow system is then a collection of flows ordered in a sequence from recharge to discharge, such that the flow segments of the system make up a connected flow path from source to destination. A water budget is a measure of the balance of recharge and discharge valid for a specific time and relative to a specific groundwater feature, such as a basin, aquifer, management area, or well.

Many of these concepts are depicted in Figure 2. Shown is a flow system (A+B) and two subsystems (A, B) that are its parts. Each subsystem is composed of interior flows, indicated by the solid lines with arrows, as well as input and output flows indicated as recharge and discharge, respectively. These flow systems are contained by three distinct hydrogeologic unit bodies, with the middle body oriented at an angle and having a K (hydraulic conductivity) value of 10-5. Intraflow is exemplified by a flow line within the right hydrogeologic unit body, while Interflow is exemplified by the flow from right body (the source container) to middle body (the destination container). The boundary between the bodies serves as the interface through which the flow occurs. While not shown, the three hydrogeologic unit bodies contain a groundwater body (i.e. a fluid body) in their pores (i.e. voids), and it is this groundwater body that is flowing.

Example flow system with two subsystems (after Freeze & Cherry, 1979, p. 204).

7.5    Wells

Well-related entities include water wells, springs, and monitoring sites. Water wells are man-made constructions for monitoring, withdrawing, or injecting water from/into a hydrogeological unit, while springs are features where water discharges to the surface naturally. Both wells and springs possess important links to the hydrogeological environment, including their host units and materials, as well as the intersecting fluid body. Monitoring sites are locations where devices are placed to measure various properties of significance to hydrogeology, such as water level, flow rate, water temperature, or chemical composition, or to take samples. As such, monitoring sites are roles played by other features, for example, water wells or springs.

7.6.1    DocumentCitation

The class DocumentCitation is abstract, and has no attributes, operations or associations. It serves as a placeholder for legislative and reference documentation for a management area. Legislative documentation refers to the legal instrument or document that required the establishment of the management area. Reference documentation might describe the environmental objectives and measures that are to be undertaken in the management area to protect the environment (a reference to a management or action plan), licensing information, and associated maps.

The ‘Legislation References’ and ‘DocumentCitation’ classes from the INSPIRE Generic Conceptual Model are possible candidates for DocumentCitation.

Requirement
	

/req/conceptual/similarity

 

Target logical models that are compliant with the conceptual model shall implement components of the conceptual model respecting their semantics, i.e. their definition and intent. In other words, the logical model must be highly semantically similar to components of the conceptual model and must not specify any requirements that would contradict or result in non-conformance to the conceptual model. Semantic similarity can be tested in multiple ways, including but not limited to: (i) direct comparison of UML components, (ii) comparison after mapping components to a common expressive knowledge representation language, such as first order logic or common logic, or (iii) comparison after mapping components to a reference ontology. The target can reuse and adapt existing logical models.

Requirement /req/conceptual/similarity

Target logical model when claiming compliance with this conceptual model SHALL implement its components (classes, attributes, relationships) respecting the conceptual model definitions and intent, such that high semantic similarity is obtained between the logical and conceptual model components, and the logical model must not specify any requirements that would contradict or result in non-conformance to the conceptual model.

 
8.    Logical Model

The logical model incorporates all concepts from the conceptual model, and maintains their general intent. It differs from the conceptual model in its introduction of technology-specific artifacts from the OGC General Reference Model and derived schemas. These include additions such as classes, relations, properties, constraints, and usage principles. Another difference is the incorporation of the well construction package from GWML1.

The logical model is not a syntactical encoding, but is an OGC-compliant schema that is syntax-neutral. Syntactical encodings are derived from the logical model, such as the reference GML encoding described herein.

The addition of OGC constructs to the conceptual model amounts to the integration of several OGC-compliant GML schemas, primarily GeoSciML 4.0 and Observations & Measurements, but also MD_Metadata and others. These are adapted using the following strategies.

      HydrogeologicalUnit in GWML2 specializes GeologicUnit from GeoSciML 4.0, recognizing that in its most basic sense a hydrogeological unit is a body of rock (a geological unit) exhibiting some hydrogeological properties including possibly fluid storage and transfer.
      Water wells and boreholes specialize O&M:SF_SamplingCurve, which allows them to have a shape described by 3D points at the start and end of each segment along the well or borehole. Wells and boreholes differ by purpose and use: boreholes are physical engineering artifacts consisting of a hole and potentially materials fitted inside the hole for some human use, and wells are constructions for the extraction or injection of water from/into the ground, and have specific hydrogeological properties such as water yield and intended use. As a consequence, well and associated borehole lengths can differ for the same well. A well can be seen as a specific role played by a borehole.
      Property values are assigned datatypes from O&M: properties that can be numeric and/or categorical are assigned the OM_Observation datatype. Two factors compel this choice: method metadata can be added to each value to describe determination of the value, and each property can be further soft-typed for greater precision. An example of the latter is the porosity property, which in pratice could refer to any of a wide range of porosity types such as effective porosity, primary porosity, or secondary porosity.
      Fluid body constituent values are modeled as observations: for example, a chemical analysis of a groundwater sample might be represented in the following way:
        Each measured value is the result of an observation;
        The observedProperty would be e.g. “As_Concentration;” and
        The featureOfInterest would be an instance of e.g. GW_ChemicalConstituent with ChemicalTypeTerm = “As” and gwState = “solid”.

    This approach is quite flexible: it allows for different mixture types (e.g. suspension, solution, emulsion), states (i.e. liquid, solid, gas), and measurement types (e.g. concentration) for a constituent type (e.g. “As”).
      Aquifer Tests are completely modelled using O&M, except for the single signature class GW_AquiferTest. This class is a property-less extension of O&M Sampling Feature.  The logical model for Aquifer Test is thus the O&M logical model, as illustrated further in Figure 17. Time series generated by aquifer tests are represented using TimeseriesML1.0 (OGC 15-042r2).
      DocumentCitation is replaced by Any type (i.e. the ‘documentation’ role is assigned a datatype of Any), in order to satisfy the original intention of the DocumentCitation class of enabling re-use of relevant classes from other schemas. This allows, for example, use of classes such as GW_Licence, MD_Metadata, INSPIRE’s DocumentCitation or LegislativeReferences.
      If an entity in the logical model is stereotyped as GMF_Feature (from the OGC General Feature Model), then any name, description and identifier attributes from the conceptual model are replaced by equivalents from GMF_Feature (e.g. GW_FluidBody::gwBodyDescription maps to AbstractFeature::description).

The logical model is organized into six application schema packages, as mentioned in Section 1.

    GWML2-Main: core items, e.g. aquifers, their pores, fluid bodies, and management areas.
    GWML2-Constituent: the biologic, chemical, and material elements of a fluid body.
    GWML2-Flow: fluid flow within and between containers, and water budgets.
    GWML2-Well: water wells, springs, and monitoring sites.
    GWML2-WellConstruction: the components used to construct a borehole or well.
    GWML2-AquiferTest: aspects associated with an aquifer test.

Because most of the differences between the logical and conceptual model can be inferred directly from the logical model UML diagrams, all diagrams are included below. Complete class descriptions are subsequently included only for additions or alterations to the conceptual model. Additions primarily include borehole construction elements and geology logs, while the alterations mainly consist of a cardinality revision: all attributes and relations are now optional, primarily to enable sparse encodings that avoid empty data fields if so desired.

9.    Requirements Classes (normative)

This section describes requirement classes for any target implementation conforming to GWML2.  Target implementations must meet related conformance class tests for at least one concrete requirements class (in Sections 9.2 and greater).  The core requirement class (Section 9.1) is abstract, therefore solely meeting the core requirements is insufficient to claim compliance with GWML2. Note, this section documents only those requirements that cannot be read directly from the UML logical model—the logical model denotes the first suite of canonical requirements, which are supplemented by those below.
9.1    Abstract requirements classes: GWML2 core logical model

This core requirement class describes requirements that must be met by all target implementations that claim compliance with GWML2 (this standard).  It also sets common requirements for all extensions of this standard.  Since this requirement class is abstract, a conformant target implementation SHALL also implement at least one concrete requirements class from Sections 9.2 and greater.

9.2.1    Feature of interest for Association classes

OM_Observation is extensively used to represent property values wherever it is useful to include supporting metadata such as the methods used to obtain the values.  As stated in ISO19156/OGC 10-004r3, the OM_Observation’s feature of interest should be the bearer of the observed property (10-004r3, clause 7.2.2.7). All properties in GWML 2.2 that use OM_Observation in the model are carried by Features; the relationship between the observation and the bearer of properties is obvious, except for two cases: GW_UnitFluidProperty (Figure 18)andGW_UnitVoidProperty (Figure 19).

GW_FluidProperty is an association class linking a GW_HydroGeoUnit and a GW_FluidBody and carries properties that are inherently related to the association of a geological unit and the fluid occupying its voids.  Not being a feature, this class cannot be the feature of interest of the properties it bears.

Association class between a GW_HydrogeoUnit and GW_FluidBody.
Figure 18: Association class between a GW_HydrogeoUnit and GW_FluidBody.

Traditionaly, those properties (gwHydraulicConductivity, gwStorativity, gwTransmissivity and gwYield) are assigned by convenience to the hydrogeological unit (GW_HydrogeoUnit), because the fluid is a body of groundwater (GW_FluidBody) that is rarely explicitly identified. Therefore, the feature of interest of all the values of GW_UnitFluidProperty SHALL be the GW_HydrogeoUnit instance at the gwFluidBodyUnit end of the GW_UnitFluidProperty association.

Requirement /req/main/observed-unit-fluid-property-foi

The feature of interest of OM_Observation values for GW_UnitFluidProperty properties (gwHydraulicConductivity, gwStorativity, gwTransmissivity and gwYield) SHALL be the GW_HydrogeoUnit instance at the gwFluidBodyUnit end of the GW_UnitFluidProperty association.

 

Similarly, GW_UnitVoidProperty is an association class linking a GW_HydroGeoUnit with a GW_HydrogeoVoid, and this association class also then cannot be the feature of interest for the properties it bears (Figure 19). 

 

Association class between a GW_HydrogeoUnit and GW_HydrogeoVoid.
Figure 19: Association class between a GW_HydrogeoUnit and GW_HydrogeoVoid.

As void properties are traditionally assigned to the hydrogeologic unit, the feature of interest of all property values of GW_UnitVoidProperty SHALL be the GW_HydrogeoUnit instance, which is located at the gwVoidUnit end of the GW_UnitVoidProperty association.

Requirement /req/main/observed-unit-void-property-foi

The feature of interest of OM_Observation values for GW_UnitVoidProperty properties (gwPermeability and gwPorosity) SHALL be the GW_HydrogeoUnit instance at the gwVoidUnit end of the GW_UnitVoidProperty association.

 

Requirement /req/main/managementArea

GW_Management’s gwAreaFeature SHALL NOT be a subtype of  GW_HydrogeoUnit.

/req/constituent/sampled-fluid-body

 

Analytical results are modelled as OM_Observation having GW_Constituent as features of interest (see Figure 20).  A typical analytical procedure involves a sampling feature (such as a SF_Specimen) and a series of OM_Observations reporting on some properties of the feature of interest.

Description: C:\Users\brodaric\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet Files\Content.Outlook\UB222WAR\observations_pattern.png
Figure 20: The pattern for analytical results.

By referring to the real world identifiable feature using the sampledFeature property, and using the observation’s featureOfInterest to refer to the constituent of the fluid body, this pattern permits a detailed description of the composition of various parts of the fluid body.

Requirement /req/constituent/sampled-fluid-body

Sampling feature SHOULD link to a real world identifiable feature through sampledFeature, while individual observations should refer to the constituent that has been measured.

Requirement
	

/req/well/monitoring-elevationCRS

The shape of the well is a 3D curve, in absolute coordinates, that represents the path of the hole in the ground.  However, it is common practice to position observations, construction artefacts, and properties of the surrounding materials along this 3D path using a 1D coordinate system relative to the beginning of the hole.  Although most wells are often assumed to be straight vertical bores, this standard allows for the generic case, where the well path is not a straight line, and therefore any such property or element needs to refer to the well path to calculate its absolute position.

This standard also provides alternative representations for commonly used origin elevations, such as the location of the well on the surface of the earth, the location and elevation of the well collar, the reference elevation for down hole properties, etc.  Note that the reference elevation and the well path are distinct reference elements but it is best practice to ensure that the reference elevation point intersect the path.  Because of the variety of practices and because the reference elevation can actually change over time (replaced headwork, subsidence, etc.) it is not always possible to have a definitive reference elevation.

Several GW_Well features need to be located relative to the well path:

    GW_GeologyLog LogValue
    Construction elements
    Any related Observation
    Any related SamplingFeature

The following set of requirements defines how to report these values:

The elevation CRS must be a relevant EPSG vertical (1 dimension) CRS. Example: EPSG:5100 (Mean Sea Level : http://epsg.io/5100-datum).

Requirement /req/well/waterwell-elevationCRS

GW_Well:gwWellReferenceElevation/Elevation:elevation CRS SHALL have a vertical datum.

9.5.2    Well shape

Requirement /req/well/waterwell-shape

GW_Well:shape SHALL be a 3D geometry that represents the complete well that includes any elements above the ground

9.5.3    Relative position

The relative positions of all elements positioned relative to the 3D shape shall be calculated from the origin point of that shape, which is the first vertex of the shape.

The relative position is the linear distance along the bore path, expressed as a positive value, using the uom inferred from the CRS of the shape z axis (metres or feet in the vast majority of cases). Different GW_Well elements may have different ways to encode the relative positions.
9.5.3.1    Observations

Any Observation that needs to be positioned along the well must provide a reference geometry (a GM_Curve) and a position along that curve.  In a case where the path is the path of the well or a borehole, the reference geometry is expected to be the shape of the well or the borehole, but it is not required.  For instance, the relative location can be a “virtual path” somewhat related to a well or a group of wells.

Requirement /req/well/waterwell-observation-spatial-reference

The reference geometry of an Observation SHALL be encoded in a om:NamedValue with the name http://www.opengis.net/def/param-name/GWML/2.2/referenceGeometry and a value of type GM_Curve.

 

The relative position shall be encoded in a specially named NamedValue.

Requirement /req/well/waterwell-observation-fromparam

Geological logs are modelled as GML discrete coverages (CV_DiscreteElementCoverage) of elements of type LogValue.  Each Log Value is composed of a pair of properties to locate the element along the Well path (fromDepth and toDepth) and a SWE DataRecord that contains an arbitrary set of fields to report properties of interest along the path (see Figure 21).

 

SWE Data Record.
Figure 21: SWE Data Record.

SWE (Clause 7.3 of OGC 08-094r1) describes the requirements to encode a DataRecord. A community that defined a common Geologic Log encoding should agree on a definition and scoped name for the DataRecord, and definitions of the individual fields composing the record.

 

For example, a community that wants to use a GeoSciML 4.0 vocabulary to encode a geology log can agree on a field type (eg: SWE Category) and a definition (a URI) to flag that field in the DataRecord as having controlled content.  Another community might chose to constrain the complete DataRecord by agreeing on the scoped name of the DataRecord itself.

Requirement /req/well-log/log-definition

The Log Value of a Geologic Log SHOULD use a community controlled definition for the DataRecord and / or the fields that compose it.

Aquifer hydraulic parameters are routinely evaluated by a series of tests that involves pumping or injecting water at known rates and by observing the changes in the water table.  Other tests might involve injecting a tracer (radio element or dye) at some location and follow its progression at observation points.  From these observations, various methods have been developed to compute aquifer properties.  To adequately report an aquifer test, the data about initial conditions, test parameters, sampling features, measured and calculated observation must be packaged and put into context.  

Figure 17, above, shows the elements required to encode an aquifer test. An AquiferTest assesses an Aquifer using a method (eg: Packer test) that is encoded as an OM_Process.  The test is performed at a test site (the GW_AquiferTest defines a geometry corresponding to the test location) and consists of sampling features (usually the GW_Well) that are associated to the GW_AquiferTest through relatedSamplingFeature.  Each sampling feature has a role in the test (observation or test features). Some sampling features are sites where test activities are performed (referred to as “test feature”), such as pumping water out of a bore. Other features are sites where more passive observations are made, such as measuring the impact of pumping made at the test sampling feature on the water table. From this activity, a series of observation are made, typically time series along the timespan of the test. Then from these observations, a method is used to infer some aquifer properties (such as transmissivity, storativity or yield).  The findings are then documented in a report that can be attached to GW_AquiferTest using generic metadata properties.

A typical AquiferTest might be sketched as follows in Figure 22:

 

A typical pumping test.
Figure 22: A typical pumping test.

9.9.1    Aquifer Test O&M mapping

Observation and Measurement (O&M 2.0 : OGC 10-004r3), along with its GWML extensions, contains all the elements needed to model an aquifer test.  A complete aquifer test can be built around SF_SamplingFeature and OM_Observation, with the addition of GW_AquiferTest, a subtype of SF_SpatialSamplingFeature (Figure 23), to distinguish aquifer tests from other sampling features and to package observations and sampling features.  

 

GW_AquiferTest.
Figure 23: GW_AquiferTest.

9.9.2    GW_AquiferTest  (O&M profile)

GW_AquiferTest is a specialized sampling feature representing an aquifer test (or pump test). It packages all the sampling features and observations generated by the test and the computed results from those observations.  The following section describes implementation of aquifer test in O&M. 
9.9.3    SF_SamplingFeature properties
9.9.3.1    sampledFeature

In the context of an aquifer test, it links to the real world feature being assessed by the aquifer test (generally a GW_AquiferUnit).  O&M does not constrain SF_SamplingFeature to any particular feature type, but this standard requires that the sampledFeature shall be a subtype of a GW_HydrogeoUnit.

Requirement /req/aquifertest/sampledfeature

The sampledFeature of a GW_AquiferTest SHALL be an instance of (or a reference to) a subtype of GW_HydrogeoUnit.

 
9.9.3.2    relatedSamplingFeature

In the context of an aquifer test, the related sampling feature property identifies all the sampling features participating in the aquifer test. The role of each feature is assigned by the SF_SamplingFeatureComplex:role property. The role of the sampling feature is scoped by the test. Therefore the same sampling feature can have different roles in different tests, but also within the same test (by having multiple SF_SamplingFeatureComplex referring to the same SF_SamplingFeature). Single bore tests are examples where the observation bore and the test bore are the same feature. This standard proposes a list of core roles to identify the observation features and test features.

The test feature is the “active” sampling feature where the test is performed (e.g. the well that is pumped or injected).

Requirement /req/aquifertest/testfeature

SF_SamplingFeatureComplex:role for the sampling feature where the test is performed SHALL have the value http://www.opengis.net/req/aquifertest/testfeature

 

The observation feature is the “passive” feature where observations are made. It is the feature at which the effects of the test are measured.

Requirement /req/aquifertest/observationfeature

SF_SampleFeatureComplex:role for the sampling feature where the observations are made SHALL have the value http://www.opengis.net/req/ gwml2-aquifer-test/observationfeature

 

A single sampling feature can be the target of several SF_SamplingFeatureComplex.  A data provider can add more than one SF_SamplingFeatureComplex to accommodate other roles (see Figure 24).

 

Multiple roles for the same well using two SF_SamplingFeatureComplexes.
Figure 24: Multiple roles for the same well using two SF_SamplingFeatureComplexes.

9.9.3.3    parameter

Test parameters, such as pumping rates during the test are not considered as being an observation, but as test parameters.  To document test parameters, there are two options:

·      Using SF_SpatialSamplingFeature:hostedProcedure of type OM_Process that can encode all possible details of a test using SensorML (OGC 12-000), MD_Metadata (ISO-19115) or any other suitable model. 

·      Use parameter of type SF_SamplingFeature:parameter:NamedValue using agreed value types for well-known test parameters.

Although the formal mechanism to report test parameters is through OM_Process, this standard recommends reporting community defined values in  simple parameter key-value pairs (KVP) using sf:NamedValue.

Requirement /req/aquifertest/testparameter

When present, SF_SamplingFeature:parameter:NamedValue SHALL be encoded using community defined values 

9.9.3.4    relatedObservation

All related observations, including the observations made at the test feature sites and observation derived from those observations should be available as related observations (sf:relatedObservation). 

Requirement /req/aquifertest/observation

All observations relevant to an aquifer test SHOULD be available as relatedObservation

 

From the raw observations measured during a test, new observations can be inferred or calculated.  The raw observations (related from the observation Features) and the derived observations (the result of the test) SHALL be related to each other using om:ObservationContext.  The role of the observation context defines which observation derives or supports the other one. ‘supportObservation’ and ‘derivedObservation’ roles can be considered complementary: if A is supportObservation of B, then B is the derivedObservation of A.

Requirement /req/aquifertest/observation-role

Raw observations from the observation sampling feature SHALL be link to the test result observations using the roles defined in Table 1

Support observation
	

http://resource.gwml.org /def/role/supportObservation
	

Observation linking to other observation used to calculate, derive or infer a new values

Derived observation
	

http://resource.gwml.org /def/role/derivedObservation
	

Observation linking to another observation that has calculated, inferred or derived values

9.9.3.5    hostedProcedure

A hostedProcedure is used to document such things as methods to identify or localise the sampling feature, but its use is not constrained to anything specific.  The hostedProcedure property, of type OM_Process, may be used to accommodate detailed aquifer test parameters if needed by the data provider. 

The O&M standard does not prescribe any model to encode OM_Process, but suggests:

ISO 19115-2 provides MI_Instrument, LE_Processing and LE_Algorithm, which could all be modelled as specializations of OM_Process. OGC SensorML [16] provides a model which is suitable for many observation procedures

OGC 10-0043 / ISO-19156, clause 7.2.3, p. 14

For instance, a pump (used to pump water from the borehole) can be modelled as a SensorML sml:PhysicalSystem.
9.9.3.6    shape

SF_SpatialSamplingFeature does not constrain the geometry type (Point, Curve, Polygon, etc), therefore any geometry can represent a test.  In most situations, the geometry of the test is the test area, the zone of influence around the pumping test or even the volume of rock affected or in scope for the test.

This standard also does not constrain the geometry type.  Communities that wish to constrain the geometry type should create a profile of this standard.
9.9.4    OM_Observation

OM_Observations are used to represent values of properties observed or computed in the context of this test. There are at least two categories of observations generated through an aquifer test:

    Raw observations, normally taken at the observationFeatures; and
    Derived observations, calculated from the raw observations.

These two kinds of observations differ by their respective feature of interest. For the former (raw data) the feature of interest is the sampling feature from which observations are made (e.g. observation bore).  In the latter case, the feature of interest is the GW_AquiferTest itself.  Observations can be linked together using related observations (om:relatedObservation/om:ObservationContext), which provide a role (om:ObservationContext/om:role) for the targeted observation.  Figure 25 shows an example of “raw” observations (Drawdown1 and Drawdown2) measured at two observation wells (obs1 and obs2). The same figure also shows a derived observation (transmissivity) having the aquifer test itself as its feature of interest.  The derived observation provides a link back to the supporting observation used to compute the derived values.

Relationships between observations and features of interest.
Figure 25: Relationships between observations and features of interest.

Observations made during the test and computed observations are modelled as OM_Observations.
9.9.4.1    phenomenonTime, resultTime and validTime

As specified in Observation and Measurement; phenomenonTime reflects the time that the result applies to the property; the resultTime is the time at which the value has been obtained or became available and validTime is the time during which the value is usable.  Depending on the type of observation (raw or computed), those time might be different (see Table 2).

9.9.4.2    observedProperty

This property describes the phenomenon being observed (e.g. groundwater level).  The observed property is normally a reference to a property inherent in the feature of interest (“the real word feature is the subject of the observation and carries the observed property, OGC-10-004r3, clause 7.2.2.7).   But because of subtle variations in the semantics of such properties (such as specific Yield versus maximum Yield versus sustainable Yield, etc.), the observedProperty meaning should be formally defined by a community.  The value of observedProperty becomes a reference to that definition (expressed in SWE, SKOS or OWL for example).

ObservedProperty can also be a compound property (a collection of observedProperty).  Again, because of the close tie to use cases, compound properties should be defined by a community.

Requirement /req/aquifertest/observedProperty

The observedProperty SHOULD be a reference to a community managed vocabulary.

 
9.9.4.3    result

The result property reports the product of the observation process. In many cases, the aquifer test will produce a time series, such as drawdown data over time. When the result is a time series, it shall be modelled as a TimeSeriesML 1.0 (OGC 15-082r3).

Requirement /req/aquifertest/timeseries

Observation producing time series SHALL be modelled as TimeSeriesML 1.0 (OGC 10-042r1)

 

Derived (or computed) observations will often produce compound values. It is possible to report each result component as distinct observations, but GWML2 shall use the more efficient alternative of wrapping compound results into swe:DataRecord.

Requirement /req/aquifertest/timeseries-datarecord

Derived or computed observations SHALL be encoded as swe:DataRecord

 
9.9.5    Aquifer test overview

Figure 26 provides an example of the mapping of AquiferTest to O&M.

Typical pump test instance: 1  sampling feature and 2 observation features.

10.    XML Implementation (normative)
10.1    GWML2-XSD

Groundwater features and their properties will be encoded in XML using standard GML encoding rules (Annex E of OGC Geography Markup Language v3.2 (ISO 19136:2007). 

In examples, HTTP URIs that are used as resolvable resources (e.g. for vocabularies) are encoded using the DTD entity resource.gwml.org to avoid binding the examples to a specific URI.  Full instance documents will have an entity declaration in the xml header in the form.

XML snippets will use the following prefixes:

ISO-19136_2007 provides a mapping between UML classifiers and XSD entities.  All XSD types and elements must be created following those mapping rules.  This standard considers the XSD files (the schema files) to be normative (they contain the official interpretation of 19136 conversion of the UML classifiers into XML). 

Requirement /req/xsd-xml-rules/W3C_XSD

All elements and attributes in a namespace SHALL validate according to W3C XSD rules encoded in the xsd file associated with this namespace and its dependencies.

 

Other rules, that can’t be expressed in XSD, are provided as schematron rules.  As the XSD files, schematron rules files are considered normative.

Requirement /req/xsd-xml-rules/ISO-schematron

All elements and attributes covered by this standard SHALL pass schematron validation rules in http://schemas.opengis.net/gwml/2.0/xml-rules.sch

 

The date-time formats will conform to ISO standards.  Although this is already a GML 3.2.1 encoding rule (clause 14.2.2.7), this format shall also be used in any string that is not normally checked for an occurrence of dates.

Requirement /req/xsd-xml-rules/iso8601-time

All date-time elements or occurrences within strings SHALL be encoded using ISO8601 extended time format

 

Note that this precludes the use of time-coordinate systems such as UNIX time. This is specified in order to be maximally consistent with WML2 requirements. The time zone will be included in the time element.

Requirement /req/xsd-xml-rules/time-zone

The value of each time element SHALL include a time zone definition using a signed 4 digit character or a ‘Z’ to represent Zulu or Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This is defined by the following regular expression:

(Z|[+-]HH:MM)

 

Greenwich Mean Time (GMT or Zulu)

Some SWE Common types are restricted to avoid ambiguity.

Requirement /req/xsd-xml-rules/swe-types

When using the SWE Common types, the following elements SHALL NOT be used: swe:quality (AbstractSimpleComponentType), swe:nilValues (AbstractSimpleComponentType), swe:constraint (QuantityType, QuantityRangeType, CategoryType). The attributes ‘optional’ and ‘updatable’ from the base type ‘AbstractDataComponent’ SHALL also not be used.

 
10.1.1    Identifier

A feature that can be accessed through Linked Data using a resolvable HTTP URI must use this HTTP URI as its global unique identifier.  In GML, this shall be  encoded using gml:identifier and code space = “http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616”.  In other words, the gml:identifier shall point to a representation of itself. 

Requirement /req/xsd-xml-rules/identifier

A resolvable resource SHALL expose its resolvable HTTP URI as a gml:identifier AND use http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616 for the codeSpace value.

For a by-reference property that refers to an external feature, the reference shall be resolvable over the web.  The reference shall be either a resolvable HTTP URI that might also match the feature’s globally unique identifier (see /req/core/identifier)or an HTTP request (for instance, a WFS GetFeature with the stored query “urn:ogc:def:query:OGC-WFS::GetFeatureById”) to the a representation of the feature in GML.

Note that elements under GWML2 namespaces can be mixed with other namespaces. For example, this standard does not have a dependency to WFS, but GWML can be serialised in a WFS document, along with features from other domains.  Failure to validate such a document does not necessarily mean that the GWML XML requirements are not met, as other external indirect instances might fail.  Therefore, this requirement class only addresses instances of GWML in an XML document.

All property by reference using xlink:href should provide a human readable label in xlink:title.

Requirement /req/xsd-xml-rules/xlink-title

If an xlink:href is used to reference a controlled vocabulary item, the xlink:title attribute SHOULD encode a text label of the referenced item.

 

Example of a casing material showing the use of xlink:href (/req/xsd-xml-rules/vocabulary-references ) and xlink:title (/req/xsd-xml-rules/xlink-title):


<gwml2wc:casingMaterial 
  xlink:href="http://www.sandre.eaufrance.fr/?urn=urn:sandre:donnees:154::CdElement:5:::referentiel:3.1:xml" xlink:title="PVC"/>

Vocabulary references for all classes of stereotype «CodeList» are implemented as gml:Reference using xlink:href and ought to be a resolvable URI in the form of an HTTP URL.

Requirement /req/xsd-xml-rules/vocabulary-reference

A resolvable HTTP URL SHOULD be used in an xlink:href when specifying references to vocabulary (CodeList) items.

Recommendation
	

/req/gwml2-well-log-xsd/log-definition

 

Log values are encoded as swe:DataRecord, which is an encoding of ISO 11404 Record.  It is a composite datatype made of 1 to many fields that are defined along with the instance (not by the XSD).  DataRecord allows any collection of fields of any SWE AbstractDataComponent. 

The DataRecord definition URI defines the structure of the data record and the semantics of the fields. This standard recommends that the definition be controlled by a community with specific use cases to address.

Requirement /req/well-log-xsd/log-definition

The definition of a DataRecord and the fields that compose it SHOULD have a defining URI governed by an appropriate community

 

Example of a complete gwWellGeology/GW_GeologyLog for geologic units illustrating how swe:DataRecord/definition specifies the field and DataRecord content for the log.

All xml elements under namespace http://www.opengis.net/gwml-aquifertest/2.2 must validate with the schema located at http://schemas.opengis.net/gwml/2.2/gwml2-aquifertest.xsd. 

Requirement /req/aquifertest-xsd/xsd

All the elements and types under namespace “http://www.opengis.net/gwml-aquifertest/2.2” SHALL validate with schema located at http://schemas.opengis.net/gwml/2.2/gwml2-aquifertest.xsd

 

XML encoding conforms to O&M XML encoding (10-025r1), sweCommon  (08-094r1) and TimeSeriesML 1.0 (OGC 10-042r1) encoding.  This extension introduces a single new class with no new property or association.

Note that, while O&M (OGC 10-004r3) proposes subtypes of (abstract) SF_SpatialSamplingFeature, based on their geometries (SF_SamplingPoint, SF_SamplingCurve, etc.), the XML encoding does not materialise any classes for these sub types, but maps (OGC 10-025r1) them all to a concrete SF_SpatialSamplingFeature.  The sub types are “soft types” and reported using sam:type property.  This property is an XML encoding artefact from 10-025r1 and is not described in the conceptual model (10-004r3).
